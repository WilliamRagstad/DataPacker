## About
Welcome to the DataPacker Project!
This is a program that simplifies the use and installation of data packages for Minecraft by acting as a centralized intermediary that handles all control over data packages in your worlds or that you develop yourself.

## Download

## Future

I believe this project has great potential to grow into an even bigger platform and meet a world wide user base. I'm thinking to expand to a large online platform which can be accessed via this client or using a browser. This is for sharing data packages between users, thus creating a large library of Minecraft's best vanilla mods!

## Donate

Do you like *DataPacker*? Or do you believe in the *further development* of the visionary platform?
**Don't hesitate to donate** to encourage me to continue developing this project.
